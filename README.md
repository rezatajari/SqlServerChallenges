## Overview

**SQLChallenges** is a personal repository for practicing and documenting SQL Server exercises. The purpose is to reinforce learning through **hands-on exercises**, ensuring that theoretical concepts are applied in practice.

The repo contains exercises covering **table management, data manipulation, constraints, views, and joins**. Each folder is self-contained and includes SQL scripts that can be run directly in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any compatible SQL client.

The philosophy behind this repository is **learning by doing**: read the instructions in each folderâ€™s README, attempt the exercises yourself, and then review the scripts to compare approaches and understand best practices.
