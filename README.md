# SQL Server Challenges

This repository is my personal space to **learn Microsoft SQL Server** by writing queries, experimenting with concepts, and solving practice challenges.

I’m using this repo to track my progress as I go through tutorials, online courses, and self-made exercises — focusing on understanding **how SQL Server works** in real-world scenarios.

---

## Purpose

- Practice SQL Server syntax and database concepts step by step  
- Write and improve queries through hands-on examples  
- Work on small SQL challenges and case studies  
- Record what I learn in a structured and consistent way  
- Build confidence with data manipulation, joins, and optimization  

---

## Learning Focus

- Creating and managing databases, tables, and relationships  
- Understanding data types, keys, and constraints  
- Querying data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregates  
- Joining multiple tables and using subqueries  
- Writing stored procedures, views, and triggers  
- Practicing performance tuning and indexing  
- Applying SQL to solve real-world problems

## My Approach

I’ll continuously:
1. Watch tutorials or read docs  
2. Try the concept myself in SQL Server  
3. Document what worked and what didn’t  
4. Create mini challenges or real examples to reinforce learning
