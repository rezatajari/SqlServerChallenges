# T-SQL Fundamentals Study

This folder contains a structured exploration of T-SQL principles based on the book **"T-SQL Fundamentals" by Itzik Ben-Gan**.

## Project Purpose
The objective of this study is to master the core principles of T-SQL to become a more effective .NET Backend Developer. Modern ORMs like Entity Framework Core abstract much of the database layer, but a deep understanding of T-SQL is essential for:
- Optimizing database performance.
- Troubleshooting inefficient LINQ-to-SQL translations.
- Understanding Logical Query Processing vs. Physical Execution.
- Writing SARGable queries that utilize indexes effectively.

## Learning Methodology
Each exercise is organized into its own directory containing:
1. **Scenario-Based README**: A description of the business problem and the technical "why" behind the solution.
2. **SQL Implementation**: Pure T-SQL code following industry best practices.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Notes on index usage, SARGability, and logical processing.

## Data Source and Environment
The exercises are executed against the **TSQLV6** sample database. 

- **Schema & Sample Data**: The scripts to build the tables and populate the data can be downloaded here: [Microsoft Press Store - T-SQL Fundamentals Code](http://microsoftpressstore.com/TSQLFund4e/downloads)
