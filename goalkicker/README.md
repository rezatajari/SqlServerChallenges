## SQL Server Practice — Based on GoalKicker PDF

This section of the repository contains **SQL Server practice exercises** derived from the [SQL Server Notes for Professionals](https://goalkicker.com/) book by GoalKicker.
The exercises are based on concepts and examples covered throughout the PDF, extended with additional self-created tasks for deeper understanding.

### Structure

This section does not follow a strict folder hierarchy like other parts of the repository.
Instead, it contains a collection of exercises inspired by different chapters and topics from the book — recreated and modified for hands-on practice.

### Purpose of This Collection

The goal of this section is to:

* Reinforce knowledge gained from the GoalKicker SQL Server book
* Provide flexible, real-world practice tasks without a predefined order
* Encourage creative problem-solving and experimentation with SQL syntax

Exercises in this folder are intended to help learners **apply theory in practice** and gradually build stronger intuition for SQL design and logic.
