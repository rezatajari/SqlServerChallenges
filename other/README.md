## Other

The **other** folder contains a collection of various SQL exercises gathered from different sources—examples I’ve come across during learning, challenges shared by others, or ideas I’ve turned into practice tasks.
The goal of this section is to organize these scattered examples into structured, executable exercises for SQL Server.

Although the exercises in this folder may not fit into the main categories of the repository, they all serve the purpose of strengthening practical SQL skills. Like the rest of the repository, each exercise includes the necessary scripts and instructions, which can be executed directly in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or any SQL Server–compatible client.

### Purpose of this folder

* Providing a flexible space for exercises that don’t belong to the primary categories
* Turning miscellaneous examples into repeatable and useful practice tasks
* Enhancing hands-on SQL skills through diverse, real-world exercises
* Storing and documenting tasks I’ve encountered or received throughout my learning journey
