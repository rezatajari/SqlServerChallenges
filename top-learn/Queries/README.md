# Queries

This folder contains SQL Server exercises focused on **retrieving and manipulating data**.  
You will practice selecting data, ordering results, and combining columns to generate new outputs.

The exercises in this folder help you **build practical querying skills** by working hands-on with tables.

## Included Exercises

* **select.sql** – Different ways to show data from a table, including selecting all columns, specific columns, and limiting results with `TOP`.
* **orderby-asc-desc.sql** – Sort query results using `ORDER BY` in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
* **concat.sql** – Combine or modify columns to generate new output columns using `CONCAT`.
* **insert-by-select.sql** – Demonstrates copying data between tables using `SELECT INTO` and inserting rows into an existing table using `INSERT INTO ... SELECT`.

## How to Use

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or another SQL client.  
2. Navigate to this folder and open a `.sql` file.  
3. Execute the commands and observe the output.  
4. Experiment by:  
   - Selecting different columns,  
   - Limiting results with `TOP`,  
   - Ordering by multiple columns,  
   - Modifying or combining columns with `CONCAT`.

## Tips for Learning

- Start with `SELECT *` to view the full table before selecting specific columns.  
- Combine `ORDER BY` with `TOP` to practice retrieving sorted subsets of data.  
- Experiment with `CONCAT` and other string functions to create custom outputs.  
- Try modifying the queries to explore variations and edge cases.
